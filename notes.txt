**Having different screens, loading different screens, switching between screens.** 

[This post references this thread.](https://forum.defold.com/t/level-switch-change-level/1064) As well as the official docs:

http://www.defold.com/manuals/collection-proxies/

Think of collections as a way to represent a screen. Main menu, game, splash ...

Then you have a central script which loads or unloads collections as you switch screens. 

If you would like you could add a super light weight inbetween screen which acts as loading screen - 
or have unique light weight loading screens depending on what kind of activities you are going to, 
and some screens you go to you may already know they are super light weight and don't need a loading screen inbetween.

Remember that some screens you may want to not be screens you switch to but ones which act as overlays.

1. The parent object's script of the collection proxies must ask for input if you want the child screens to be able to get input
2. If you get the below error edit your .collection files in a text editor and change their name: from default 
- the file name is NOT this name

ERROR:GAMEOBJECT: The collection 'default' could not be created since there is already a socket with the same name.

Remember that even in the different screens you may be loading / unloading proxy collections as you need them for that screen.
